I. About Extrusion Editor
========================= 
The software is available to you for free evaluation. You are entitled to evaluate the software for up to 30 days without obligation to pay. After 30 days, if you decide to keep the software, you must register your copy. Please note that this version of Extrusion Editor is disabled. You cannot insert an extrusion into VrmlPad with more than 15 spine segments.

This trial version is expandable to full (it includes the option "Register..." at the About Extrusion Editor dialog box).

Extrusion Editor is a VRML97-compliant pluggable application for ParallelGraphics' VrmlPad and it provides the opportunity to create geometric shapes based on the Extrusion node in developing virtual worlds written in VRML. This tool allows you to create impressive models from scratch and provides an efficient way to edit an existing extrusion (VRML code).

Extrusion Editor includes features that help you work conveniently and quickly. Take a look at its capabilities:

 - Visual support for the creation of extrusions, a customizable
   plan view, and multiple undo/redo.
 - Advanced interactive texture mapping (Cortona VRML client must
   be installed).
 - Built-in Material Editor that provides functions to create and
   edit materials.
 - Smoothing technique. The ability to create the cross-section and
   spine based on the smooth Bezier curves (spline curves for
   generating trajectory).
 - Shapes. Combines a set of extrusions into a single group.
 - Library. This contains the library of the already created 
   extrusions. Adding the created extrusion to the library and 
   inserting its code into VrmlPad.
 - All manipulations with extrusion parameters are dynamically
   displayed in the 3D window (Cortona VRML client must be
   installed).
 - VRML97 compliance: you can import and export objects in VRML97
   format as well as view created models in all major VRML browsers.
 - You can copy the extrusion parameters or material onto the
   clipboard and paste them on the other shape in your model.
 - The created shape can be inserted into VrmlPad as an Extrusion
   or IndexedFaceSet node.
