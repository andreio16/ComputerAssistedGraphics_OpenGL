    VrmlPad 1.2 (trial)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    VrmlPad is a powerful and flexible authoring tool from ParallelGraphics
    that allows you to design and develop professional VRML content.
    Use VrmlPad to create VRML worlds for publishing on the World Wide Web.
    VrmlPad fully supports the VRML 97 specification.

    What's New
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    + Automation and Scripting

    From this version VrmlPad provides VrmlPad Object Model that enables
    authors and developers to manipulate the program from external
    applications using the C, C++, Visual Basic(R), Borland Delphi(R).
    In addition, power users can now create add-ins, VBScript and JavaScript
    macros and execute them from within the VrmlPad environment, automating
    custom tasks and adding visual support.

    + Node Folding

    Node folding lets you hide a body of huge nodes and prototype
    declarations. Also you can define a set of uninteresting nodes that
    collapses automatically on scene load.

    + Preview using multiple VRML viewers

    In addition to preview a scene using default Web browser with a default
    VRML viewer, now you can choose a viewer from a list of installed in the
    system VRML viewers. To do this, from the View menu, choose Options and
    select the Preview tab. Then select Show a choice... option.

    + Keyboard shortcuts customization

    On the Shortcut Keys page of the Options dialog you can assign custom
    shortcut key combinations to all VrmlPad commands (including macro and
    add-in commands).

    + Inlining resources

    Now publishing wizard can include resources into VRML file body as
    base64 encoded data, excluding them from the list of publishing files.
    VRML files with in-lined resources are currently supported only by
    ParallelGraphics Cortona VRML viewer.

    + Inserting Anchors and External prototypes

    In addition to inserting Inline nodes as a result of drag-and-drop
    VRML files from File List or Resource View, it's possible now to insert
    also Anchor nodes and EXTERNPROTO declarations.
